       rogomatic,  rgmgene,  rgmhist, rgmscatter - Automatically Exploring The
       Dungeons of Doom

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [4mrogomatic[24m [ [4m-cefprstuw[24m or [4msave_file[24m ]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mRog-O-Matic[24m is a computer fantasy game with a newer twist.  It  is  crt
       oriented and the object of the game is to automatically survive the at-
       tacks  of various monsters and get a lot of gold, rather than having to
       actually type the required commands yourself.

       Once you have entered the world of [4mRog-O-Matic[24m  you  will  stay  there,
       passively  watching  the  game  unfold before you much like a catatonic
       teenager watching television.  Should you wish to intervene, type the [1mt[0m
       command and [4mRog-O-Matic[24m will enter transparent mode. Here you can  type
       several  commands,  the  most  useful of which is the [1m?  [22mcommand, which
       prints out the next help line. Press the [1m?  [22mkey repeatedly to  see  all
       of the help.  Some useful commands are: [1mh j k l H J K L b n y u f s > <[0m
       [1mS Q.  [22mThese have the same meaning as in normal Rogue. To return to [4mRog-[0m
       [4mO-Matic[24m mode, type the [1mt [22mcommand again.

       Some useful commands are:

       [1mt      [4m[22mToggle,[24m  toggles  the  setting  of the [4mtransparent[24m mode flag. In
              transparent mode, [4mRog-O-Matic[24m will not automatically attack mon-
              sters, pick up  treasure,  or  explore  around.   Unfortunately,
              there is no way to enter complicated commands like [4mquaff[24m or [4mread[0m
              in  transparent  mode.  Typing any [4mRogue[24m command, or single-step
              command also enables transparent mode.

       [1mQ      [4m[22mQuit,[24m tells [4mRog-O-Matic[24m to quit the game. The score is logged in
              the score file, and possibly the [4mRogue[24m top ten, and the game  is
              terminated.

       [1mS      [4m[22mSave,[24m  the  game  is  saved to the default save file, set by the
              [4m<file>[24m argument to [4mrogomatic[24m or the [4mROGUEOPTS[24m environment  vari-
              able. The game may be restarted later.

       [1mc      [4m[22mCheat,[24m  tells [4mRog-O-Matic[24m to take advantage of idiosyncracies in
              the [4mRogue[24m game to get a higher score. This is unfortunately nec-
              essary to allow fair competition with other human top ten  play-
              ers  who  take advantage of the same bugs. Note that this option
              should only be used on the Unix 3.6 version of Rogue, since  the
              VMS  version does not exhibit the same bugs.  Note too that when
              playing against [4mRogue[24m [4m5.2[24m and [4mRogue[24m [4m5.3[24m  no  cheating  is  done,
              since  the  bugs are not widely known and used by human competi-
              tion.

       [1md      [4m[22mDebugging,[24m toggles the debugging flag, which is useless to  non-
              wizard players (although it is entertaining if your terminal has
              reverse video).

       [1me      [4m[22mEchoing,[24m  causes  a  copy  of  the  game  to  be written to file
              [4mroguelog[24m in the current directory. Typing [1me [22ma second time closes
              the log file.  When the game is ended, the roguelog file is  re-
              named to <killer>.<level>.<score> so if a troll killed poor [4mRog-[0m
              [4mO-Matic[24m  on  level 14 leaving him with a score of 3088, the file
              would be named [4mtrol.14.3088.[24m  Note  that  only  the  first  four
              characters  of the killer are used.  The [1m-p [22moption will replay a
              saved game.  Additionally, a stop action command  (carriage  re-
              turn gives a single step) has been added.

       [1mi      [4m[22mInventory,[24m dumps the current inventory on the screen.

       [1mm      [4m[22mMonster[24m  [4mlist,[24m  shows the current long term memory evaluation of
              the monsters.  [4mRog-O-Matic[24m nows keeps a long  term  memory  file
              (for  each version of Rogue) in the score directory, and records
              the meanness of each monster it finds.  This command prints  out
              the  letter,  name,  and  strength of each monster.  Strength is
              listed as three numbers: expected damage (scaled by 10) and max-
              imum damage (unscaled) are shown in parentheses,  and  the  mean
              number  of  arrows required to kill a monster is shown in square
              brackets.

       [1mCR     [4m[22mSingle[24m [4mstep,[24m a carriage return  enables  [4mtransparent[24m  mode,  and
              causes  [4mRog-O-Matic[24m  to single-step. The command sent is printed
              at the bottom right hand of the screen.

       [1m/      [4m[22mSnapshot,[24m a timestamp, the current screen, and the  current  in-
              ventory  are appended to file [4msnapshot.rgm[24m in the current direc-
              tory.

       [1m$      [4m[22mWeaponrank,[24m dumps [4mRog-O-Matic's[24m current estimate of his  weapons
              rankings.

       [1m%      [4m[22mArmorrank,[24m  dumps  [4mRog-O-Matic's[24m  current  estimate of his armor
              rankings.

       [1m=      [4m[22mRingrank,[24m dumps [4mRog-O-Matic's[24m current estimate of his ring rank-
              ings.

       [1m-      [4m[22mStatus,[24m prints out a status line indicating various things  like
              whether  [4mRog-O-Matic[24m  is  confused,  has  red  hands, is wearing
              cursed armor or wielding a cursed  weapon,  and  which  monsters
              have been genocided.  It also prints the number of turns elapsed
              in the game.

       [1m`      [4m[22mSummary,[24m a backquote prints a short summary of the game.

       [1m~      [4m[22mVersion,[24m prints the version of [4mRogue[24m and [4mRog-O-Matic[24m being used.
              It also prints the current goal score.

       [1mG      [4m[22mGenotype,[24m displays the settings of the genetically learned para-
              meters  of the genotype playing now.  See section [4mGenes[24m for more
              information about these parameters.

       [1mR      [4m[22mReplay[24m [4mposition,[24m allows you to skip around in a  log  file  when
              replaying  an  old game.  This key must be followed by either [1mf,[0m
              [1mp, c, n, [22mor [1ml.  [22mThese indicate you wish to see the [4mfirst,[24m [4mprevi-[0m
              [4mous,[24m [4mcurrent,[24m [4mnext,[24m or [1mlast [22mlevels of the game.  The first  time
              you  enter  the [1mR [22mcommand, there will be a pause of several sec-
              onds while the whole log file is digested.  After this  initial-
              ization,  there  should  be no delay when skipping around in the
              log file.  After you have skipped once, the program won't termi-
              nate at the end of the file until you enter the  [1mQ  [4m[22m(quit)[24m  com-
              mand.   This  way  you  can  replay  the  last  level  over (and
              over...).

       When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or when [4mRog-O-[0m
       [4mMatic[24m dies horribly of some bug, you will not get a list of the top-ten
       scorers.  The scoring is based entirely upon useless  criteria  anyway.
       [4mRog-O-Matic[24m  does keep a list of its games. To see the best [4mRog-O-Matic[0m
       games, use "rogomatic -s" which dumps the current scores in reverse or-
       der.

       [1m-t     [22mTerse mode. In terse mode, [4mRog-O-Matic[24m will only print a summary
              after each level explored.

       [1m-u     [22mUser mode. Tells [4mRog-O-Matic[24m to start up in transparent mode, so

              level 1.

[1mGENES[0m
       The [1mG [22mcommand lists the current settings for each [4mRog-O-Matic's[24m ``DNA''
       settings. These numbers (from 0 to 99) specify  some  of  [4mRog-O-Matic's[0m
       behaviors.   A  gene  pool  file  is  kept  in the score directory that
       records the current population of explorers.  A  variant  of  Holland's
       ``Genetic Algorithm'' is used to manipulate this gene pool.  The result
       is that [4mRog-O-Matic[24m learns from his past games how to play better.  The
       following genes are currently used:

       [1mSr     [22mHow  many times to search each square for traps (0 to 4, depend-
              ing on amount of food and how far below level 7 he is).

       [1mDr     [22mHow many times to search each square for secret doors (0 to  19,
              more for dead end passages not in mazes).

       [1mRe     [22mHow much to rest up when injured (until 40% to 80% healed, based
              on experience level).

       [1mAr     [22mWhen to shoot arrows at enemies, the higher the number, the more
              likely  [4mRog-O-Matic[24m is to shoot arrows at monsters (both smaller
              monsters, and more arrows).

       [1mEx     [22mHow soon to experiment with unknown potions and scrolls (between
              levels 1 and 10).

       [1mRn     [22mHow likely he is to run from an opponent (the higher the number,
              the sooner he will run).

       [1mWk     [22mHow likely he is to wake a sleeping  opponent  (the  higher  the
              number, the bigger the monster he will attack, even though it is
              sleeping).

       [1mFd     [22mHow  likely  he  is  to hoard extra food.  This affects how many
              rings he wears, and how much he searches for traps.

[1mFILES[0m
       There are two executable files: rogomatic and player.  Rogomatic  is  a
       small  program  which  forks and execs the Rogue process and then execs
       the player process.  Thus you must have access to all of  these  files.
       These are available as

            /usr/mlm/bin/rogomatic on the GP-Vax
            /usr/mlm/bin/player on the GP-Vax

       If  you are moving these files to another machine, you must either edit
       the rogomatic module to change the name of the player process,  or  run
       rogomatic from a directory containing the player module.

       The score file is kept in

            /usr/mlm/lib/rogomatic/rgmscore<version>
            /usr/mlm/lib/rogomatic/rgmdelta<version>

       If this file does not exist, it is created.  The gene pool is kept in

            /usr/mlm/lib/rogomatic/GenePool<version>

       A log of all mutations and crossovers is kept in

            /usr/mlm/lib/rogomatic/GeneLog<version>

       The long term memory of monster attributes is kept in

            /usr/mlm/lib/rogomatic/ltm<version>

       A log of internal errors and bugs is kept in

            /usr/mlm/lib/rogomatic/error<version>

[1mOTHER PROGRAMS[0m
       Several  programs  are used to summarize and display [4mRog-O-Matic's[24m per-
       formance.  The are in  /usr/misc/.rogomatic/bin.  The  [4mrgmgene[24m  command
       summarizes  the  current  population  in the gene pool.  The [4mrgmscatter[0m
       command prints a scatter plot of all  scores  in  the  scorefile.   The
       [4mrgmhist[24m command prints a histogram of score (or levels if the [1m-l [22moption
       is given).

[1mBUGS[0m
       Occasionally  [4mRog-O-Matic[24m  will dead-lock waiting for input from [4mRogue.[0m
       When this happens, type an interrupt and enter  the  [4mt[24m  command  again.
       This  usually  wakes  it up enough to re-start the game.  In completely
       unusual cases, try interrupting and then entering the [4mS[24m command to save
       the game, and then re-start with "rogomatic  -r".  Sometimes  you  will
       have  to  use  transparent mode to get it down to the next level before
       turning it loose again.
